# React Native Template RePack

This template allows you to bootstrap a new React Native project with [RePack](https://re-pack.netlify.app/) already included.

## Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template https://github.com/lukaszchopin/react-native-template-repack.git

```

This template only works with the new CLI.
Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first:

```sh
npm uninstall -g react-native-cli
yarn global remove react-native-cli
```

If you wish to not use `npx`, you can also install the new CLI globally:

```sh
npm i -g @react-native-community/cli
```

or

```sh
yarn global add @react-native-community/cli
```
